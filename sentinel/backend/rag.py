SENTINEL — Retrieval & Knowledge Base (rag.py)

Hybrid retrieval layer with two paths:
  1. FALLBACK_KB  → always available, covers all 6 fault types, zero deps
  2. PDF RAG      → loads ECSS PDFs via LlamaIndex, embeds with
                    sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, local/free),
                    stores/queries via ChromaDB (local persistent mode)

The public API is:
  retrieve_procedures(query, fault_cues, top_k, use_pdf_rag) → list[str]

Retrieval priority (when use_pdf_rag=True):
  1. Try PDF RAG (ChromaDB similarity search over ECSS chunks)
  2. If PDF RAG fails for ANY reason → fall back to FALLBACK_KB
  3. FALLBACK_KB keyword-matches fault cues → returns top-k entries
  4. If nothing matches → returns MULTI_CASCADE catch-all (never empty)

Graceful degradation guarantees:
  - Missing PDFs                → fallback KB
  - sentence-transformers missing → fallback KB
  - LlamaIndex import error     → fallback KB
  - ChromaDB error              → fallback KB
  - PDF parsing failure         → skip bad PDF, index the rest
  - Zero results from RAG       → fallback KB

PROCEDURE: ADCS Gyroscope Single-Event Upset (SEU) Recovery
SOURCE: Based on ECSS-E-ST-70-11C principles for safe mode recovery \
and ECSS-Q-ST-30-02 dependability requirements.

FAULT SIGNATURE:
- SEU_COUNTER spikes from baseline (0) to a non-zero value
- GYRO_A_RATE or GYRO_B_RATE returns NaN or a constant frozen value \
immediately after the SEU event
- ATTITUDE_ERROR grows progressively as ADCS loses attitude knowledge
- Safe mode triggered when ATTITUDE_ERROR exceeds threshold (typically 5 deg)

CAUSAL MECHANISM:
A cosmic ray or trapped particle strikes the gyroscope processor, causing \
a single-event upset (bit flip). This corrupts the rate measurement, making \
the ADCS unable to determine spacecraft orientation. Without valid attitude \
data, the spacecraft cannot maintain sun pointing, and ATTITUDE_ERROR grows \
until the safe mode threshold is exceeded.

KEY DIAGNOSTIC RULE:
Always check SEU_COUNTER first. If it spiked near the time GYRO_RATE went \
anomalous, this is radiation-induced — NOT a hardware failure. Recovery is \
software reset, not hardware replacement.

RECOVERY SEQUENCE:
1. CMD_VERIFY_SEU_COUNTER — Read SEU counter to confirm radiation event. \
Wait 5s. Verify: SEU_COUNTER read successfully. Risk: LOW.
2. CMD_GYRO_A_DRIVER_RESET — Software reset of the gyroscope driver to \
clear corrupted state from SEU. Wait 30s. Verify: GYRO_A_RATE returns a \
valid float value. Risk: LOW.
3. CMD_ATTITUDE_REACQUISITION — Use star tracker and sun sensor to \
re-establish attitude knowledge. Wait 60s. Verify: ATTITUDE_ERROR < 1 deg. \
Risk: MEDIUM.
4. CMD_SAFE_MODE_EXIT — Return spacecraft to nominal operations. Wait 30s. \
Verify: normal_mode_flag = 1. Risk: LOW.

SAFETY NOTES:
- Do NOT attempt attitude maneuvers until gyroscope health is confirmed \
(GYRO_A_RATE returns valid data).
- If SEU_COUNTER continues to increment after driver reset, suspect a \
persistent radiation environment — escalate to human review.
- If GYRO_A fails to recover after reset, switch to GYRO_B backup.""",

PROCEDURE: EPS Solar Array Undervoltage Recovery
SOURCE: Based on ECSS-E-ST-70-11C power subsystem recovery and \
EPS fault management guidelines.

FAULT SIGNATURE:
- I_sa (solar array current) drops to near 0A while spacecraft is in sunlight
- V_bat drifts downward from nominal (28–33.6V) toward critical (<22V)
- Battery SoC begins falling as load exceeds generation
- EPS fault flag set when V_bus exits safe operating range

CAUSAL MECHANISM:
Solar array current drops to zero while the spacecraft is in a sunlit \
orbital position (not eclipse). This indicates either: (a) solar array \
hardware failure, (b) incorrect sun angle calculation causing the panels \
to point away from the sun, or (c) a deployment mechanism failure in a \
newly launched spacecraft.

KEY DIAGNOSTIC RULE:
Check orbital_position in the crash dump. If the spacecraft is sunlit and \
I_sa ≈ 0, this is NOT an eclipse. It is a genuine solar array or pointing \
fault. Do not dismiss it as an eclipse-related transient.

RECOVERY SEQUENCE:
1. CMD_VERIFY_SUN_ANGLE — Confirm spacecraft has valid sun pointing using \
sun sensor. Wait 10s. Verify: sun_sensor_angle < 90 deg. Risk: LOW.
2. CMD_SOLAR_ARRAY_A_RESET — Attempt to re-initialize the solar array \
drive electronics. Wait 30s. Verify: I_sa > 2A within 30s. Risk: LOW.
3. CMD_SWITCH_SOLAR_ARRAY — If Array A fails, switch to Array B or \
alternative power path. Wait 30s. Verify: I_sa recovery on alternate array. \
Risk: MEDIUM.
4. CMD_BATTERY_CONSERVATION — Shed non-critical loads to preserve remaining \
battery capacity. Wait 10s. Verify: SoC stabilizes. Risk: LOW.
5. CMD_SAFE_MODE_EXIT — Only after power generation is confirmed restored. \
Wait 30s. Verify: V_bat > 27V and rising. Risk: LOW.

SAFETY NOTES:
- NEVER command safe mode exit while battery SoC < 20%. The spacecraft \
could brown out during transition.
- If V_bat has dropped below 22V, this is CRITICAL. Minimize all commands \
until power is restored.
- Monitor V_bat trend after array reset — if not recovering within 60s, \
switch to backup array.""",

PROCEDURE: OBC Software Watchdog Timeout Recovery
SOURCE: Based on ECSS-E-ST-70-11C onboard computer recovery procedures \
and software fault management requirements.

FAULT SIGNATURE:
- CPU_LOAD sustained at 100% (software infinite loop)
- Memory usage monotonically increasing (possible memory leak)
- WATCHDOG_COUNTER overflows (timer not refreshed due to stuck software)
- Forced reboot occurs, triggering safe mode

CAUSAL MECHANISM:
A software bug (triggered by unusual input data, timing condition, or \
memory corruption) causes the main flight software to enter an infinite \
loop or deadlock. The CPU saturates at 100%, preventing the watchdog timer \
from being refreshed. When the watchdog overflows, the OBC performs a \
forced hardware reboot, which triggers safe mode entry.

KEY DIAGNOSTIC RULE:
If CPU_LOAD = 100% AND WATCHDOG_COUNTER overflowed, this is near-certain \
an OBC software fault. Check memory usage trend — if monotonically \
increasing, confirms a runaway process. NOT a hardware fault.

RECOVERY SEQUENCE:
1. CMD_CONFIRM_COMMS_LOCK — Verify communications lock on low-gain antenna \
BEFORE any OBC operations. Wait 5s. Verify: TRANSPONDER_LOCK = 1. Risk: LOW.
2. CMD_OBC_CONTROLLED_REBOOT — Perform a clean controlled reboot of the \
onboard computer (not a power cycle). Wait 60s. Verify: CPU_LOAD returns \
to nominal (<70%). Risk: MEDIUM.
3. CMD_VERIFY_MEMORY_STATE — Check that memory usage is stable (not \
monotonically increasing). Wait 10s. Verify: memory_usage stable. Risk: LOW.
4. CMD_SAFE_MODE_EXIT — Return to nominal operations. Wait 30s. \
Verify: normal_mode_flag = 1. Risk: LOW.

SAFETY NOTES:
- CRITICAL: Always confirm comms lock on low-gain antenna BEFORE rebooting \
OBC. An OBC reboot without comms lock risks permanent loss of contact.
- If the same software fault recurs after reboot, suspect a persistent \
trigger — escalate to human review with requires_human_review = true.
- If CPU_LOAD does not drop after reboot, suspect hardware-level fault \
(processor damage). Set risk to HIGH.""",

PROCEDURE: TCS Thermal Runaway Recovery (Heater Stuck ON)
SOURCE: Based on ECSS-E-ST-70-11C thermal control and ECSS-Q-ST-30-02 \
dependability requirements for thermal protection.

FAULT SIGNATURE:
- HEATER_ZONE_* remains in ON state without cycling OFF
- Component temperature rises continuously beyond operational range
- Critical threshold exceeded (>85°C for most electronics, >125°C for \
survival limit)
- Safe mode triggered by over-temperature protection

CAUSAL MECHANISM:
A heater control relay or thermostat fails in the closed (ON) position, \
causing continuous heating of a spacecraft zone. Without the normal \
on/off cycling, component temperature rises unchecked until it exceeds \
the safe operating range or survival limit.

KEY DIAGNOSTIC RULE:
Thermal runaway is TIME-CRITICAL. Unlike other faults, prolonged \
overheating causes permanent hardware damage. Recovery priority is to \
disable the stuck heater IMMEDIATELY, before other diagnostics.

RECOVERY SEQUENCE:
1. CMD_DISABLE_HEATER_ZONE — Disable the affected heater zone immediately. \
Wait 5s. Verify: HEATER_ZONE status = OFF. Risk: LOW.
2. CMD_MONITOR_TEMPERATURE — Monitor component temperature for cooling \
trend. Wait 120s. Verify: TEMP reading is decreasing. Risk: LOW.
3. CMD_VERIFY_THERMAL_MARGIN — Confirm temperature has returned to safe \
operating range. Wait 300s. Verify: TEMP < 50°C for electronics. Risk: LOW.
4. CMD_SAFE_MODE_EXIT — Only after temperature is within safe range. \
Wait 30s. Verify: normal_mode_flag = 1. Risk: LOW.

SAFETY NOTES:
- Thermal runaway can cause PERMANENT DAMAGE. Recovery urgency is higher \
than other fault types.
- If temperature has already exceeded survival limit (>125°C), the \
component may be permanently damaged. Set requires_human_review = true \
and confidence should be lower due to uncertainty about hardware state.

    content="""\
PROCEDURE: Communications Transponder Loss Recovery
SOURCE: Based on ECSS-E-ST-70-11C communications subsystem recovery \
and ground-link management procedures.

FAULT SIGNATURE:
- TRANSPONDER_LOCK drops from 1 to 0 (loss of carrier lock)
- SNR falls below 5 dB (severe signal degradation)
- Ground station loses telemetry and command link
- Safe mode may trigger automatically due to loss of ground contact \
timeout

CAUSAL MECHANISM:
Transponder hardware failure, power supply fault to the transponder, \
antenna pointing error, or frequency drift causes loss of the \
communication link between the spacecraft and ground station.

KEY DIAGNOSTIC RULE:
Without comms, no ground commands can reach the spacecraft. Recovery \
depends on onboard autonomous capability OR a pre-programmed backup \
transponder switch timer. Check if a backup transponder is available.

RECOVERY SEQUENCE:
1. CMD_SWITCH_BACKUP_TRANSPONDER — Switch to redundant transponder unit. \
Wait 30s. Verify: TRANSPONDER_LOCK = 1 on backup unit. Risk: MEDIUM.
2. CMD_VERIFY_SIGNAL_ACQUISITION — Confirm signal quality with ground \
station. Wait 15s. Verify: SNR > 10 dB. Risk: LOW.
3. CMD_CONFIRM_GROUND_CONTACT — Verify two-way communication link is \
established. Wait 10s. Verify: ground station confirms telemetry \
reception. Risk: LOW.
4. CMD_SAFE_MODE_EXIT — Return to nominal operations. Wait 30s. \
Verify: normal_mode_flag = 1. Risk: LOW.

SAFETY NOTES:
- This is a unique fault type: recovery may need to be fully autonomous \
since ground cannot send commands without the transponder.
- If backup transponder also fails, the spacecraft enters a comms blackout. \
Set requires_human_review = true (even though no one can command it — the \
flag is for the log record).
- For deep space missions, comm loss is especially critical due to long \
round-trip light times.""",

PROCEDURE: Multi-Subsystem Cascade Failure Diagnosis and Recovery
SOURCE: Based on ECSS-E-ST-70-11C cross-subsystem fault propagation \
analysis and ECSS-Q-ST-30-02 failure mode identification.

FAULT SIGNATURE:
- Anomalies observed in 2 or more subsystems with temporal correlation
- Example cascade: ADCS gyro fault → spacecraft tumbles → solar panels \
lose sun pointing → I_sa drops → battery drains → EPS fault
- The MOST RECENT anomaly is often a SYMPTOM, not the root cause

CAUSAL MECHANISM:
A primary fault in one subsystem propagates to other subsystems through \
physical dependencies. Common cascades:
1. ADCS → EPS: Attitude loss → solar panels misaligned → power loss
2. EPS → TCS: Power loss → heaters disabled → thermal excursion
3. OBC → everything: Software crash → all subsystem control lost

KEY DIAGNOSTIC RULE:
ALWAYS identify the INITIATING fault (earliest anomaly in the timeline), \
not just the most recent symptom. Look at the event_log timestamps and \
pre_fault_telemetry progression to find which parameter went anomalous \
FIRST. Confidence should be LOWER for cascade faults (0.50–0.70) because \
the causal chain is more complex and ambiguous.

RECOVERY STRATEGY:
1. Address the root cause (initiating fault) FIRST.
2. Then recover downstream subsystems in dependency order.
3. Do NOT try to fix symptoms while the root cause is still active.

Example recovery for ADCS → EPS cascade:
1. Fix the gyro/ADCS fault (driver reset, attitude reacquisition)
2. Once attitude is restored, solar panels regain sun pointing
3. Verify power generation is recovering (I_sa rising, V_bat stabilizing)
4. Only then exit safe mode

SAFETY NOTES:
- ALWAYS set requires_human_review = true for cascade faults.
- Confidence should typically be 0.50–0.70 for cascades.
- If you cannot clearly identify the initiating fault, state this \
explicitly in reasoning_summary.
- Recovery order matters: fixing downstream symptoms before the root \
cause can make things worse.""",
